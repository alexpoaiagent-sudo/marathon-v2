# Session Context Summary: Marathon Materials Restructuring

## Overview
This document details a comprehensive restructuring of marathon materials completed on January 8, 2026, across seven major work blocks.

## Key Accomplishments

**File Reorganization:** All meeting files were renumbered (questionnaire became `00_questionnaire.md`, meetings shifted from `02-05` to `01-04`).

**Meeting 1 Expansion:** Added substantial content on exocortex concepts and writing-based thinking, introduced the AI assistant tool, and moved four practical techniques from later sessions into immediate post-meeting assignments.

**Self-Study Materials:** Created four comprehensive guides spanning each inter-meeting period, transforming the marathon from meeting-centric to practice-focused.

**Navigation Updates:** Refreshed internal links across 7 files and updated the project dictionary to reflect new practice categories.

## Philosophical Shift

The restructuring embodies a crucial principle: "participants practice immediately after Meeting 1 rather than waiting for Meeting 2." This transforms follow-up sessions into reflection points rather than starting points.

As the document notes: "основная работа происходит между встречами" (the primary work happens between meetings).

## Statistics
- 13 files modified
- 593 lines added, 185 removed
- 4 new self-study files created

The materials now establish a logical progression from initial state description through hypothesis testing, documented observation, and product creation across the four-meeting cycle.
